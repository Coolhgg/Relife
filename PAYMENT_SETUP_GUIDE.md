### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file:

```env
# Replace these with your actual Stripe keys
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key_here"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_your_actual_secret_key_here"
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_your_webhook_secret_here"

# Make sure these are also configured
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="your_actual_supabase_url"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_actual_supabase_key"
```

### Step 3: Start Your Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the API server
npm run api:dev

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend
npm run dev
```

**That's it!** Your payment system is now live! üéâ
