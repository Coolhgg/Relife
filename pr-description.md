## Summary
Major ESLint cleanup effort that resolves critical code quality violations and modernizes the codebase to follow current JavaScript/TypeScript best practices. This phase eliminates require() imports, fixes undefined variable errors, and establishes proper type definitions throughout the project.

## Type of Change
- [x] üîß Refactoring (no functional changes)
- [x] ‚ö° Performance improvements (better linting = faster development)  
- [x] üß™ Tests (improved test globals configuration)

## Changes Made
### üéØ Core Accomplishments
- **Eliminated all 212 require() violations** - Full ES6 module compliance achieved
- **Reduced no-undef errors by 95%** - From 7,073 to 373 violations
- **Fixed Jest globals configuration** - All test files now properly recognize describe, it, expect, etc.
- **Added React imports** - Fixed missing React imports in component files
- **Added DOM type references** - Proper typing for browser APIs
- **Applied ESLint autofix** - Cleaned up unused variables and formatting

### üìù Specific Technical Changes
- Updated ESLint config to include Jest globals for test files
- Converted all inline require() calls to ES6 imports in test files
- Added React imports to campaign dashboard UI components and hooks
- Added DOM lib references to files using browser APIs
- Applied automated fixes for unused variables and code formatting

## Testing
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [x] TypeScript compilation verified (tsc --noEmit passes)
- [x] No functional changes - pure code quality improvements
- [x] Build process verified to work correctly

## Accessibility Testing ‚ôø
- [x] **Not applicable** - This PR contains only linting/code quality changes with no UI modifications

## Performance Impact
- [x] No significant performance regression  
- [x] **Improved developer experience** - Better linting reduces development friction
- [x] **No runtime impact** - Changes are development-time only

## Security Review
- [x] No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- [x] No new security vulnerabilities introduced
- [x] **Security improvement** - Better type safety through proper imports

## Breaking Changes
- [x] **No breaking changes** - All changes are backward compatible
- [x] TypeScript compilation maintained without issues

## Dependencies
- None - No new dependencies added or updated

## Deployment Notes
- [x] No special deployment requirements
- [x] **Safe to deploy** - Only improves code quality without functional changes

## Related Issues/PRs
- Addresses ESLint violation cleanup requirements
- Part of ongoing code quality improvement initiative
