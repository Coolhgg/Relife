# React Hooks Exhaustive-Deps Violations - Fix Summary

## Overview

Successfully resolved react-hooks/exhaustive-deps violations across key components in the Relife
alarm application.

## Files Fixed

### 1. src/App.tsx

- **Fixed refreshRewardsSystem useCallback**: Added missing `setAppState` dependency
- **Fixed handleServiceWorkerMessage useCallback**: Added missing `setAppState`, `setSyncStatus`,
  and `setIsOnline` dependencies
- **Removed duplicate functions**: Eliminated duplicate `handleServiceWorkerMessage` and
  `handleAlarmSnooze` function definitions
- **Verified other useEffect hooks**: Confirmed `track` and `trackSessionActivity` dependencies were
  already present

### 2. src/hooks/useFocusTrap.ts

- **Documented intentional ESLint disable**: Added comprehensive comment explaining why the cleanup
  effect intentionally has an empty dependency array
- **Justification**: The effect should only run on unmount to restore focus, not when
  `restorePreviousFocus` function changes

### 3. src/components/AlarmList.tsx

- **Fixed useEffect dependencies**: Added missing `announceEnter` and `alarms.length` to dependency
  array
- **Effect purpose**: Announces alarm list content to screen readers

### 4. src/components/OfflineIndicator.tsx

- **Fixed useEffect dependencies**: Added missing `fetchServiceWorkerStats` dependency
- **Event handlers**: Confirmed that event handlers defined inside the useEffect don't need to be in
  dependency array

### 5. Other Components Verified

- **useTheme.tsx**: `getThemeRecommendations` useCallback already had correct `[availableThemes]`
  dependency
- **PersonaAnalyticsDashboard.tsx**: All useMemo hooks already had correct dependencies

## Technical Details

### Key Patterns Fixed

1. **Missing stable function dependencies**: Functions defined outside hooks but used inside
2. **Missing state setter dependencies**: Though React guarantees state setters are stable, included
   for completeness
3. **Duplicate function definitions**: Removed conflicting duplicate function declarations

### Intentional Violations

1. **Cleanup-only effects**: One properly documented case where empty dependency array is
   intentional (focus restoration on unmount)

## Verification

- TypeScript compilation passes without errors for the main hooks files
- No React runtime hook warnings expected
- All dependency arrays now correctly reflect the variables and functions used within their
  respective hooks

## Impact

- Eliminates React hook warnings in development console
- Prevents potential runtime bugs from stale closures
- Improves code reliability and follows React best practices
- Maintains expected component behavior while ensuring proper re-execution when dependencies change
