## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### **Manual Testing Required**
Due to dependency conflicts in the development environment, manual browser testing is recommended:

1. **Start Development Server**: 
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Offline Functionality**:
   - Open browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Set to "Offline" mode
   - Verify all features work:
     - Create and join battles
     - Track sleep sessions
     - View analytics
     - Cache performance

3. **Test Sync Behavior**:
   - Go back online
   - Verify automatic synchronization
   - Check conflict resolution
   - Monitor cache updates

### **PWA Testing Scripts**
- `npm run test:pwa` - Browser compatibility testing
- `npm run test:lighthouse` - Performance and PWA compliance

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### **Cache Limits** (configurable in `sw-unified.js`)
```javascript
const CACHE_LIMITS = {
  STATIC: 50 * 1024 * 1024,    // 50MB
  DYNAMIC: 100 * 1024 * 1024,  // 100MB
  API: 10 * 1024 * 1024,       // 10MB
