# Security Improvements Report - Relife Application

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive security enhancements implemented for the Relife alarm
application. The improvements address critical vulnerabilities and implement industry-standard
security practices.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. Authentication & Session Management

- **Fixed variable reference bug** in authentication hook preventing runtime errors
- **Removed hardcoded JWT secret fallbacks** to prevent weak security in production
- **Enhanced session timeout management** with 30-minute sessions and 15-minute inactivity timeouts
- **Implemented CSRF token generation** and validation for all authenticated requests
- **Added rate limiting** for authentication attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes)

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)

- **Eliminated unsafe-inline directives** by implementing nonce-based CSP
- **Added comprehensive CSP directives** for all content types
- **Implemented secure script and style loading** with cryptographically secure nonces
- **Configured upgrade-insecure-requests** to enforce HTTPS

### 3. Security Headers Implementation

- **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy**: same-origin
- **Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy**: cross-origin
- **Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy**: credentialless
- **Permissions-Policy**: Disabled unnecessary browser APIs
- **Clear-Site-Data**: Automatic cleanup on logout
- **X-Robots-Tag**: Prevents API endpoint indexing

### 4. API Key Management System

- **Secure key generation** with crypto.randomBytes(32)
- **Environment-specific prefixes** (rl*dev*, rl*stg*, rl*live*)
- **Comprehensive validation** with IP/origin restrictions
- **Rate limiting integration** with violation tracking
- **Automatic key rotation** capabilities
- **Usage analytics** and security monitoring
- **Database schema** with Row Level Security policies

### 5. Input Sanitization & XSS Prevention

- **Advanced sanitization service** with 13 input type configurations
- **Multi-layered security checking** for XSS, SQL injection, code injection
- **DOMPurify integration** with configurable policies
- **React hooks and components** for seamless integration
- **Higher-order components** for automatic sanitization
- **Batch processing** capabilities

### 6. Password Security Enhancement

- **Enhanced validation requirements**: minimum 2 of each character type
- **Advanced pattern detection**: keyboard patterns, sequential characters
- **Dictionary word checking** for common password patterns
- **Entropy calculation** with 50-bit minimum recommendation
- **Password history validation** to prevent reuse
- **Personal information detection** to block obvious patterns
- **Risk level assessment**: low/medium/high/critical

### 7. Dependency Security

- **Removed vulnerable redux-devtools-extension** (incompatible with Redux v5)
- **Updated ajv package** from v6.12.6 to v8.17.1 (addresses security vulnerabilities)
- **Updated multiple packages** to latest secure versions
- **Resolved dependency conflicts** for better security posture

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Strategy

1. **Input Layer**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
2. **Application Layer**: Enhanced authentication and authorization
3. **Transport Layer**: Secure headers and CSP policies
4. **Data Layer**: Encrypted storage and secure key management

### Risk Mitigation

- **XSS Attacks**: Multi-layer input sanitization with DOMPurify
- **CSRF Attacks**: Token-based protection with secure generation
- **Session Hijacking**: Secure session management with timeouts
- **Brute Force**: Rate limiting with progressive delays
- **Code Injection**: Pattern detection and input validation
- **Data Breach**: Encrypted storage and secure key handling

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks

1. Fixed authentication variable bug
2. Removed hardcoded JWT secret fallbacks
3. Strengthened Content Security Policy
4. Implemented comprehensive security headers
5. Created enterprise-grade API key management system
6. Added advanced input sanitization framework
7. Updated vulnerable dependencies
8. Enhanced password strength validation
9. Improved session management security

### ðŸ“Š Security Metrics

- **Password Requirements**: 12+ characters, 2+ of each type, entropy >50 bits
- **Session Timeout**: 30 minutes maximum, 15 minutes inactivity
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 auth attempts per 15 minutes
- **API Key Security**: SHA-256 hashing, IP restrictions, usage tracking
- **Input Sanitization**: 13 input types, XSS/injection protection

## Security Best Practices Implemented

- Principle of least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Secure by default
- Zero trust architecture
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Regular security validation

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

1. Regular security audits and penetration testing
2. Continuous dependency monitoring and updates
3. Security awareness training for development team
4. Implementation of Web Application Firewall (WAF)
5. Regular backup and disaster recovery testing
6. Security incident response plan development

## Conclusion

The Relife application now implements comprehensive security controls that address all major web
application vulnerabilities. The layered security approach provides robust protection against common
attack vectors while maintaining usability and performance.
