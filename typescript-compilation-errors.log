TypeScript Compilation Errors - AppState Initialization Issue
================================================================

MAIN ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
src/App.tsx(152,54): error TS2345: Argument of type '{ user: null; alarms: never[]; activeAlarm: null; permissions: { notifications: { granted: false; }; microphone: { granted: false; }; }; isOnboarding: true; currentView: "dashboard"; activeBattles: never[]; ... 4 more ...; theme: "minimalist"; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'AppState | (() => AppState)'.
  Type '{ user: null; alarms: never[]; activeAlarm: null; permissions: { notifications: { granted: false; }; microphone: { granted: false; }; }; isOnboarding: true; currentView: "dashboard"; activeBattles: never[]; ... 4 more ...; theme: "minimalist"; }' is missing the following properties from type 'AppState': currentTheme, themeConfig, personalization, availableThemes

MISSING REQUIRED PROPERTIES IN AppState INITIALIZATION:
- currentTheme: Theme
- themeConfig: ThemeConfig  
- personalization: PersonalizationSettings
- availableThemes: ThemePreset[]

ADDITIONAL ISSUES FOUND:
1. Missing messageId in emotional response objects:
   - Line 705: Property 'messageId' missing in EmotionalResponse type
   - Line 763: Property 'messageId' missing in EmotionalResponse type

2. Type mismatch in currentView:
   - Line 1640: Type '"pricing"' is not comparable to allowed currentView values
   - Need to add 'pricing' to the currentView union type in AppState

3. Undefined lastTriggered property:
   - Line 1038: Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'Date' for lastTriggered

4. JSX configuration issues (not related to AppState but affecting compilation)

ANALYSIS:
The main issue is that the AppState interface has been enhanced with new required theme and personalization properties, but the initial state in App.tsx only includes the legacy 'theme' property and is missing the new required fields.

Current AppState initialization (line 152-169):
```typescript
const [appState, setAppState] = useState<AppState>({
  user: null,
  alarms: [],
  activeAlarm: null,
  permissions: {
    notifications: { granted: false },
    microphone: { granted: false }
  },
  isOnboarding: true,
  currentView: 'dashboard',
  activeBattles: [],
  friends: [],
  achievements: [],
  tournaments: [],
  teams: [],
  theme: 'minimalist'  // Legacy field - new required fields missing
});
```

Required missing fields from AppState interface:
- currentTheme: Theme
- themeConfig: ThemeConfig
- personalization: PersonalizationSettings  
- availableThemes: ThemePreset[]
- themeStore?: ThemeStore (optional)

SOLUTION APPROACH:
1. Define safe default values for all missing required AppState properties
2. Initialize all required fields in the AppState object
3. Extract defaults to a constants file for maintainability
4. Update currentView type to include 'pricing'
5. Fix other related type issues
