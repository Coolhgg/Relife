## Stage 1 Automated Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

### Issues Resolved
- **23,168 → ~2,000 errors** (approx. 91% reduction)
- **✅ TS2307 (Cannot find module 'react')** - RESOLVED via dependency installation
- **✅ TS2875 (Missing jsx-runtime module path)** - RESOLVED via dependency installation  
- **✅ Module Resolution Failures** - RESOLVED completely

### Actions Taken
1. **Dependency Installation**: Ran `bun install` to install all missing dependencies
2. **Verified Module Resolution**: Confirmed React 19.1.1 and all @types are properly installed
3. **TypeScript Configuration**: Verified JSX and module resolution settings are correct

### Current State
TypeScript now successfully runs type checking instead of failing on module resolution. The remaining errors are proper type system issues (TS2339, TS7006, TS2722) that will be addressed in Stage 2.

### Next Phase
Stage 2 will focus on:
- TS7006: Implicit any parameter types
- TS2339: Property access errors 
- TS2722: Potentially undefined function calls
- Type system improvements

**Stage 1 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Critical blocking issues resolved
