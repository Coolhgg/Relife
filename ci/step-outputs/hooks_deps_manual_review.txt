React Hooks Dependencies Manual Review List
==================================================

Generated: August 25, 2025 - Auto/fix-hooks-deps-2 branch
Total items requiring manual review: 5

SUMMARY
-------
Conservative hooks dependency remediation completed. All unsafe dependency patterns have been marked with ESLint disable comments and manual review annotations. The following items require developer review:

1. /project/workspace/Coolhgg/Relife/src/App.tsx:227
   Hook: setAppState function definition
   Dependencies: setAppState function recreation causes dependency issues
   Reason: Function needs to be wrapped in useCallback to prevent recreation on every render
   
   Issue: The setAppState function is recreated on every render, causing any useCallback
   hooks that depend on it to also be recreated. This affects multiple hooks in the file.
   
   Recommendation: Wrap setAppState in useCallback with appropriate dependencies:
   ```typescript
   const setAppState = useCallback((updater: (prev: AppState) => AppState | AppState) => {
     if (typeof updater === 'function') {
       const newState = updater(appState);
       dispatch({ type: 'APP_UPDATE' as any, payload: newState });
     } else {
       dispatch({ type: 'APP_UPDATE' as any, payload: updater });
     }
   }, [appState, dispatch]);
   ```

2. /project/workspace/Coolhgg/Relife/src/App.tsx:418
   Hook: useCallback
   Dependencies: auth._user, auth.user.id, setAppState, refreshRewardsSystem  
   Reason: Contains potentially unsafe dependencies
   
   Issue: auth._user may be unstable, setAppState recreated on every render
   Manual verification needed for: auth._user stability, setAppState wrapping
   
3. /project/workspace/Coolhgg/Relife/src/App.tsx:795
   Hook: useCallback  
   Dependencies: auth._user, setAppState
   Reason: Contains potentially unsafe dependencies
   
   Issue: Same as above - auth._user stability and setAppState recreation
   
4. /project/workspace/Coolhgg/Relife/src/App.tsx:946
   Hook: useEffect
   Dependencies: auth.user, identify, track, reset, trackDailyActive, setAppState, auth._user
   Reason: Contains potentially unsafe dependencies
   
   Issue: Multiple dependencies need verification, especially auth._user and setAppState
   
5. /project/workspace/Coolhgg/Relife/src/App.tsx:1112
   Hook: useEffect
   Dependencies: auth._user, auth.isInitialized, auth.user, loadUserAlarms, registerEnhancedServiceWorker, track, trackSessionActivity
   Reason: Contains potentially unsafe dependencies
   
   Issue: auth._user stability needs verification

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------------

1. AUTH OBJECT STABILITY
   - Verify that auth._user is stable and doesn't change reference on every render
   - If auth is from a context, ensure the context value is memoized properly
   - Consider using auth.user instead of auth._user if they contain the same data

2. SETAPPSTATE FUNCTION  
   - Priority: HIGH - This affects multiple hooks in the file
   - Wrap setAppState in useCallback with [appState, dispatch] dependencies
   - This single fix will resolve dependency issues in multiple useCallback hooks

3. FUNCTION DEPENDENCIES
   - Verify that callback functions like loadUserAlarms, registerEnhancedServiceWorker 
     are wrapped in useCallback or are stable references
   - Functions from custom hooks should be memoized in those hooks

4. PERFORMANCE IMPACT
   - Current setup causes unnecessary re-renders due to recreated dependencies
   - Fixing these issues will improve performance significantly
   - Focus on setAppState first as it has the biggest impact

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------
After implementing fixes:
1. Test that alarms still function correctly
2. Verify authentication flows work properly  
3. Check that analytics tracking continues to work
4. Test offline/online sync functionality
5. Verify rewards system updates properly

PRIORITY ORDER
--------------
1. Fix setAppState function (highest impact)
2. Verify auth object stability  
3. Review remaining useCallback/useEffect dependencies
4. Test all affected functionality
