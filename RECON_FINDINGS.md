# Jest Serializer Issue - Recon Findings

## Problem Summary
Jest configuration references `@emotion/jest/serializer` but the package is not installed.

## Package Manager
- **Used**: bun (confirmed by bun.lock presence)
- **Install command**: `bun add`

## Current State Analysis

### Dependencies Check
- ❌ `@emotion/jest` NOT found in package.json dependencies
- ❌ `@emotion/jest` NOT found in devDependencies

### @emotion Usage Scan  
- ❌ No actual @emotion usage found in source code (src/, components/)
- ✅ Only references are:
  - jest.config.js line 213: `snapshotSerializers: ['@emotion/jest/serializer']`
  - Lock files and node_modules (indirect references)
  - Vite plugin documentation (example only)

### Error Reproduction
```bash
$ node -e "require('@emotion/jest/serializer')"
Error: Cannot find module '@emotion/jest/serializer'
```

### Test Execution Status
- Multiple test failures due to various configuration issues
- Main issue: Jest fails to start due to missing @emotion/jest dependency

## Decision: Path B (Remove/Guard Serializer)
**Reasoning**: @emotion is not actually used in the codebase, so installing the dependency would be unnecessary bloat.

## Next Steps
1. Remove or guard the @emotion/jest/serializer reference in jest.config.js  
2. Run tests to confirm Jest starts properly
3. Create PR with changes

## Files to Modify
- `jest.config.js` - Remove line 213 or add conditional guard
