## Integration Testing

### Validated Components
âœ… **Type Safety** - All TypeScript interfaces updated correctly  
âœ… **Database Schema** - Premium features properly configured in all subscription tiers  
âœ… **Service Logic** - Premium validation working in voice and battle services  
âœ… **UI Integration** - Premium gates functional across all difficulty selectors

## Architectural Decisions

### Premium Gating Strategy

- **Upgrade pathways**: Clear call-to-action buttons for premium upgrades
