# Accessibility Audit Report - Finding Final 5 Issues

## Current Status
After fixing 20+ redundant ARIA roles and 8 keyboard navigation issues, conducting final audit to identify remaining 5 accessibility issues.

## Comprehensive Accessibility Check

### 1. Interactive Elements without Keyboard Support ✅
- All `tabIndex={0}` elements now have `onKeyDown` handlers
- All interactive div elements have proper keyboard support

### 2. Images without Alt Text ✅ 
- All `<img>` elements have proper alt attributes
- Decorative images use `alt=""` and `aria-hidden="true"`

### 3. Form Labels ✅
- All input elements have proper labels via `htmlFor` or `aria-labelledby`
- All form controls are properly associated

### 4. Semantic HTML ✅
- Redundant ARIA roles removed from semantic elements
- Proper heading hierarchy maintained

### 5. Screen Reader Support ✅
- 30 `aria-live` regions for dynamic announcements
- 53 screen-reader-only elements for context

## Areas Requiring Investigation

### Focus Management
- Skip links present but may need enhancement
- Focus trapping in modals
- Focus restoration after navigation

### Color Contrast
- CSS custom properties may have contrast issues
- Dynamic theme switching validation

### Error Handling
- Form validation messages
- Error announcements

### Navigation Structure
- Landmark roles consistency
- Tab navigation order

## Next Steps
1. Run focused accessibility audit tools
2. Check specific focus management patterns
3. Validate color contrast ratios
4. Test screen reader announcements
5. Verify keyboard navigation flow
