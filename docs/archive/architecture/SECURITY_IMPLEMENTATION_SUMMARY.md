   import AlarmSecurityIntegrationService from "./services/alarm-security-integration";
   ```

2. **Use secure operations for all alarm actions:**

   ```typescript
   // Secure alarm creation
   const result = await AlarmSecurityIntegrationService.createAlarmSecurely({
     id: "operation_id",
     type: "create",
     userId: "user_id",
     data: alarmData,
     context: { source: "web_app", authenticated: true },
   });
   ```

3. **Add the security dashboard to your UI:**

   ```tsx
   import ComprehensiveSecurityDashboard from "./components/ComprehensiveSecurityDashboard";

   // Use in your app
   <ComprehensiveSecurityDashboard />;
   ```

4. **Monitor security status:**
   ```typescript
   const status = await AlarmSecurityIntegrationService.getSecurityStatus();
   console.log("Security Status:", status.overall);
   ```

The security system is now fully operational and ready to protect your alarm data with enterprise-grade security measures.
