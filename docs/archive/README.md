# Relife Historical Archive

This archive preserves important historical documentation that was removed during repository cleanup
but has value for understanding the project's evolution, architectural decisions, and implementation
history.

## üìÅ Archive Structure

### `/migrations/` - Database Migration History

Contains historical database migration files that were part of the project's evolution:

- **`struggling-sam-migration.sql`** (381 lines) - User persona optimization migration focusing on
  the "Struggling Sam" persona. Includes database schema changes for user persona tracking and
  behavioral analysis.

- **`analytics-migration.sql`** (367 lines) - Comprehensive analytics system setup migration.
  Establishes the foundation for user behavior tracking, conversion analytics, and performance
  metrics collection.

- **`student-tier-migration.sql`** (166 lines) - Student pricing tier migration that introduced
  educational discounts and student-specific features to the pricing model.

### `/architecture/` - Architectural Decision Records

Documents key architectural decisions and their rationale:

- **`SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Comprehensive overview of security decisions,
  implementation patterns, and rationale behind authentication, authorization, and data protection
  strategies.

- **`PREMIUM_MONETIZATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Architecture and reasoning behind the payment system,
  subscription models, and premium feature gating strategies.

- **`PERSONA_DRIVEN_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Design philosophy and implementation details for
  the user persona system that drives personalized experiences throughout the application.

- **`MOBILE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Mobile-specific architectural decisions, performance
  optimizations, and UX adaptations for mobile platforms.

### `/analysis/` - Technical Analysis and Reports

Contains detailed technical analysis and issue reports:

- **`corruption-report.json`** (7,806 lines) - Comprehensive file corruption analysis report
  generated during repository maintenance. Contains detailed information about file integrity
  issues, patterns identified, and remediation steps taken.

- **`corruption-summary.md`** - Human-readable summary of the corruption analysis, highlighting key
  findings and the resolution process.

### `/implementation/` - Implementation Summaries

_Currently empty - reserved for future implementation documentation_

## üìö Purpose and Context

These files were preserved because they contain:

1. **Historical Context** - Understanding how certain features and systems evolved
2. **Architecture Rationale** - The reasoning behind key technical decisions
3. **Migration History** - Database evolution tracking for troubleshooting and rollbacks
4. **Technical Analysis** - Detailed reports on system health and issue resolution

## üîÑ Restoration Details

**Restored on:** August 19, 2025 **Source:** Commit HEAD~1 (prior to cleanup PR #189) **Restoration
Reason:** Historical documentation value identified post-cleanup

## üöÄ Usage Guidelines

- These files are **read-only archives** - they should not be modified
- For current documentation, refer to the main `/docs/` directory
- Database migrations here are **historical only** - do not run them on current systems
- Architecture documents provide context but may not reflect current implementation
