2. **Monitor effectiveness** for 1-2 weeks before adding more
3. **Adjust priorities** based on your lifestyle
4. **Disable ineffective conditions** after 30 days

## 🎯 Step 4: Review Optimization (Tab 3)

### **What You'll See:**
- **5 optimal wake times** with confidence scores
- **Sleep stage predictions** (light sleep, REM, deep sleep)
- **Condition factors** affecting each time slot

### **How to Use This Information:**
```
Example Display:
🌅 6:30 AM - 85% confidence - Light sleep stage ✅ BEST
🌅 6:35 AM - 78% confidence - REM transition
🌅 6:40 AM - 72% confidence - Light sleep stage  
🌅 6:45 AM - 65% confidence - REM sleep
🌅 6:50 AM - 58% confidence - Deep sleep ❌ AVOID
```

### **Optimization Tips:**
- **Green times (>80% confidence)**: Ideal wake-up windows
- **Yellow times (60-80%)**: Acceptable alternatives
- **Red times (<60%)**: Avoid if possible
- **Sleep stages**: Light sleep = easier wake-up, Deep sleep = groggy

## 📝 Step 5: Set Up Feedback Collection (Tab 4)

### **Feedback Settings:**
```
Automatic Feedback Collection: ✅ ON
- Triggers: After each alarm dismissal
- Frequency: Every wake-up (recommended)
```

### **Feedback Questions You'll See:**
1. **Wake-up difficulty**: 😴 Very Hard → 😊 Very Easy
2. **Overall feeling**: 😞 Terrible → 😄 Excellent  
3. **Sleep quality**: ⭐ 1-10 stars
4. **Time to fully awake**: 0-60 minutes
5. **Time preferences**: Earlier/Later checkboxes
6. **Optional notes**: Free text feedback

### **Why Feedback Matters:**
- **Trains the AI** to understand your preferences
- **Improves accuracy** of future recommendations
- **Personalizes adjustments** to your unique patterns
- **Takes 30 seconds** but provides weeks of better wake-ups

## 📊 Step 6: Monitor Analytics (Tab 5)

### **Key Metrics to Track:**

#### **Success Indicators:**
```
Wake-Up Satisfaction: Target >80%
Average Difficulty: Target <3.0 (out of 5)
Adaptation Success: Target >75%
Time to Fully Awake: Decreasing trend
```

#### **Condition Effectiveness:**
```
Weather Adjustments: 85% effective ✅
Calendar Events: 92% effective ✅  
Sleep Debt: 78% effective ✅
Weekend Mode: 95% effective ✅
```

### **Weekly Review:**
1. **Check satisfaction trends** - Should improve over 2-4 weeks
2. **Review condition effectiveness** - Disable <50% effective conditions
3. **Monitor adaptation frequency** - Should stabilize after learning period
4. **Adjust settings** based on performance data

## 🔧 Step 7: Fine-Tuning After First Week

### **Common Adjustments:**

#### **If AI Adapts Too Much:**
- Reduce learning factor to 0.2
- Increase confidence threshold to 0.7
- Reduce max daily adaptations to 3

#### **If AI Doesn't Adapt Enough:**
- Increase learning factor to 0.4
- Enable more conditions
- Provide detailed feedback consistently

#### **If Wake-Up Times Are Inconsistent:**

- Disable low-priority conditions
- Use "Conservative" preset

#### **If Battery Drains Quickly:**
- Use "Battery Saver" monitoring mode
- Disable unused conditions
- Increase monitoring interval to 30 minutes

## 📱 Step 8: Advanced Features Setup
