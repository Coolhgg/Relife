  ```typescript
  // Example: LCP tracking implementation
  if ('PerformanceObserver' in window) {
    const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
      list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
        this.webVitals.lcp = entry.startTime;
        this.reportWebVital('lcp', entry.startTime);
