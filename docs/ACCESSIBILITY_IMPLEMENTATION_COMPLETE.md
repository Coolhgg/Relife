- **Helper Hooks**: useAccessibleAnimation, useAccessibleTouch, useAccessibleFocus, useAccessibleColors
- **Custom Hooks**: useKeyboardNavigation, useKeyboardFocusTrap, useRovingFocus for navigation patterns

### 4. **Enhanced Keyboard Navigation** ⌨️
- **Integrated System**: Fully integrated with accessibility preferences
- **Comprehensive Shortcuts**: 15+ keyboard shortcuts across navigation, alarm management, and accessibility
- **Skip Links**: Auto-generated with customizable visibility
- **Roving Focus**: Arrow key navigation for toolbars and tab lists

- **Smart Behavior**: Respects reduced motion and screen reader preferences

### 5. **CSS Accessibility Framework** 🎨
- **Dynamic Styling**: CSS custom properties for real-time updates
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 400+ lines of accessibility-specific CSS
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses efficient selectors and avoids expensive operations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-specific accessibility improvements
- **Print Accessibility**: Special handling for screen reader users printing content

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### **Memory Management**
- **Cleanup Functions**: Proper cleanup in all services to prevent memory leaks
- **Event Listener Management**: Automatic removal of event listeners on cleanup
- **Service Lifecycle**: Singleton pattern prevents duplicate service instances

### **DOM Performance**
- **Batched Updates**: CSS changes are batched to minimize DOM manipulation
- **Efficient Selectors**: Uses class-based selectors instead of expensive attribute selectors  
- **Style Caching**: Dynamic stylesheets are cached and reused when possible
- **Debounced Updates**: Rapid preference changes are debounced to prevent excessive updates

### **System Integration**
- **Media Query Optimization**: Efficient use of system preference detection
- **LocalStorage Handling**: Graceful degradation when storage is unavailable
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling ensures accessibility never breaks the app
