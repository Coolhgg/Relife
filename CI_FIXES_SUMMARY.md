# GitHub Actions CI Fixes for Bun Support

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Package Manager Compatibility
**Problem**: Workflows were configured for npm but project uses Bun
**Solution**: 
- Replaced `actions/setup-node` with `oven-sh/setup-bun@v2`
- Changed `npm ci` to `bun install --frozen-lockfile`  
- Updated all `npm run` commands to `bun run`
- Updated `npx` commands to `bunx`

### 2. Deprecated Actions
**Problem**: Using deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` and `actions/download-artifact@v3`
**Solution**: Updated to `@v4` versions

### 3. Lock File Recognition
**Problem**: CI looking for `package-lock.json` but Bun uses `bun.lock`
**Solution**: Removed npm cache configuration since Bun handles caching differently

## New Workflows Created

### 1. PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)
- Streamlined workflow focused on essential checks
- Proper Bun integration
- Core validation: type-check, lint, format, test, build
- Mobile build validation for Android
- Automatic PR status comments

### 2. Production Deploy (`deploy-production-bun.yml`)
- Simplified deployment pipeline with Bun
- Multi-stage deployment (staging → production)
- Build artifact management
- Smoke testing and notifications

## Workflows Backed Up
- `pull-request.yml` → `pull-request.yml.bak` (old npm-based workflow)
- `deploy-production.yml` → `deploy-production.yml.bak` (old npm-based workflow)

## Key Changes Made

### Package Manager Setup
```yaml
# Old (npm-based)
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'

# New (Bun-based)
- name: Set up Bun
  uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
  with:
    bun-version: latest
```

### Dependency Installation
```yaml
# Old
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci --production=false

# New  
- name: Install dependencies
  run: bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

### Command Execution
```yaml
# Old
- name: Run tests
  run: npm run test:coverage

# New
- name: Run tests  
  run: bun run test:coverage
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster CI**: Bun's faster installation and execution
2. **Consistency**: CI environment matches development environment
3. **Reliability**: No more cache mismatch issues between npm and Bun
4. **Modern**: Using latest GitHub Actions versions

## Workflows Status

✅ **Active Workflows**:
- `pr-validation.yml` - For pull request validation
- `deploy-production-bun.yml` - For production deployments  
- `chromatic.yml` - Already Bun-compatible
- Other translation/e2e workflows should work as-is

⚠️ **Backed Up Workflows**:
- `pull-request.yml.bak` - Can be removed after testing
- `deploy-production.yml.bak` - Can be removed after testing

## Testing

The new workflows will be tested on the next PR. Key areas to monitor:

1. Dependency installation speed and success
2. Build process completion
3. Test execution and coverage reporting
4. Deployment artifact creation
5. Mobile build validation

## Future Improvements

1. Add E2E test integration with Playwright
2. Implement progressive rollout strategies
3. Add performance regression testing
4. Enhance security scanning with Bun-specific tools

## Dependabot Compatibility

The existing `dependabot.yml` will continue to work as Bun uses the same `package.json` format as npm. Dependencies will be updated normally and Bun will handle them correctly.
