# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

The Relife project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices,
vulnerability reporting process, and how we maintain the security of our alarm and productivity
application.

## 📋 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported  | Notes                  |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 2.x.x   | ✅ Yes     | Current stable version |
| 1.x.x   | ⚠️ Limited | Critical fixes only    |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No      | End of life            |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Quick Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible.

**🔐 Private Reporting (Preferred)**

- Use GitHub's
  [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/Coolhgg/Relife/security/advisories/new)
- Or email: [security@relife.app](mailto:security@relife.app)

**⚠️ Do NOT:**

- Open public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Discuss vulnerabilities in public forums or social media
- Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities

### Report Details

Please include the following information in your security report:

1. **Vulnerability Description**
   - Clear description of the security issue
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Potential impact and affected components

2. **Technical Details**
   - Affected versions
   - Environment details (OS, browser, device)
   - Proof of concept (if applicable)

3. **Suggested Fix**
   - Your assessment of the vulnerability
   - Potential solutions or mitigations

## 🔄 Response Process

### Our Commitment

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 3-5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Based on severity (see timeline below)

### Severity Timeline

| Severity | Response Time | Resolution Target |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Critical | < 24 hours    | < 7 days          |
| High     | < 48 hours    | < 14 days         |
| Medium   | < 72 hours    | < 30 days         |
| Low      | < 1 week      | < 90 days         |

### Process Steps

1. **Triage**: Security team evaluates the report
2. **Confirmation**: Reproduce and validate the vulnerability
3. **Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
4. **Fix Development**: Create and test security patch
5. **Release**: Deploy fix and update documentation
6. **Disclosure**: Coordinate responsible disclosure

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper expiration

#### Input Validation

- **Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented
- **SQL Injection**: Prepared statements and parameterized queries
- **File Upload**: Strict file type and size validation

#### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications over secure connections
- **Token Security**: JWT with proper expiration and refresh
- **CORS**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing

### Infrastructure Security

#### Hosting & Deployment

- **Cloud Security**: Following cloud provider security best practices
- **Container Security**: Regular base image updates and scanning
- **Network Security**: Firewalls and network segmentation
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring and alerting

#### Development Security

- **Secure SDLC**: Security integrated throughout development lifecycle
- **Code Review**: Mandatory security-focused code reviews
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Static Analysis**: Continuous static application security testing (SAST)

### Mobile Security

#### React Native & Capacitor

- **App Store Security**: Following platform security guidelines
- **Certificate Pinning**: Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Root/Jailbreak Detection**: Enhanced security on compromised devices
- **Local Storage**: Secure storage for sensitive data

#### Permissions

- **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary device permissions
- **Runtime Permissions**: Dynamic permission requests
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA when available
- **App Updates**: Keep the application updated
- **Device Security**: Use device lock screens and encryption
- **Suspicious Activity**: Report any unusual account activity

### For Developers

- **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP secure coding practices
- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Dependency Updates**: Keep all dependencies current
- **Security Testing**: Regular security testing and audits
- **Incident Response**: Know the security incident procedures

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Daily automated dependency scans
- **Code Analysis**: Static and dynamic security analysis
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular third-party security assessments
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous compliance checking

### Metrics & KPIs

- Mean time to vulnerability detection
- Mean time to vulnerability resolution
- Security test coverage percentage
- Number of security issues found vs. resolved

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

- **Third-party Dependencies**: Some dependencies may have unfixed vulnerabilities
- **Legacy Browser Support**: Limited security features on older browsers
- **Offline Functionality**: Some security features require network connectivity

### Planned Improvements

- Enhanced encryption for local data storage
- Advanced threat detection and response
- Expanded security monitoring and alerting
- Additional compliance certifications
