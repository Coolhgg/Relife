feat: comprehensive developer tools suite with advanced debugging capabilities

🛠️ Advanced Developer Tools Suite Implementation
- Add Redux DevTools integration with state persistence and time travel debugging
- Implement draggable Developer Dashboard with tabbed interface (Ctrl+Shift+D activation)
- Create Performance Monitor with real-time FPS, memory usage, and Core Web Vitals tracking
- Add API Monitor with comprehensive HTTP request/response inspection and export
- Implement Accessibility Panel with WCAG compliance testing and color contrast checking
- Create Component Inspector with React debugging, props/state inspection, and profiling  
- Add Error Tracker with comprehensive error reporting and user action context
- Include DevTools Provider for global setup and keyboard shortcut management
- Add Redux DevTools Test component for integration validation

📊 Technical Implementation
- Complete TypeScript integration with typed hooks and interfaces
- Production-safe development-only activation with zero performance impact
- Professional draggable interface with minimize/maximize functionality
- Real-time monitoring with throttled performance optimizations
- Comprehensive browser API integration with feature detection and fallbacks
- Memory management with automatic cleanup and leak prevention

📖 Documentation & Testing
